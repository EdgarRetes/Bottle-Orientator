# Bottle-Orientator
I collaborated with my teammates on a project in robotics class. We made a bottle orientator designed for production lines. This device ensures the bottles are placed correctly by aligning all bottles in the same direction. We developed the orientator using C++ and Arduino. In the process, we  integrated light sensors and servo motors, crafting a system that efficiently orients bottles. The prototype, was built entirely from scratch, showcasing our skills in robotics and problem-solving.
